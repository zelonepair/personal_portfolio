I have rebuilt this site at least five times. Previous versions leaned heavily on whatever framework I
was learning that month. This iteration is intentionally calmer: plain Astro, a focus on writing, and
just enough styling to make the reading experience pleasant.

**What you can expect:**

- Weeknotes covering the experiments I run while learning new tools.
- Tactical front-end write-ups, especially around accessibility and testing.
- Occasional deep dives into the processes that make teams effective (planning, documentation,
  deployments).

After years of juggling markdown files, I finally wired the project for GitHub Pages. That means each
push to `main` runs tests, builds the static site, and ships to production automatically. Future
posts will break down how the workflow is assembled so you can copy it into your own projects.

Thanks for stopping by. If you'd like updates, add the RSS feed to your reader or just peek back
whenever curiosity strikes.
