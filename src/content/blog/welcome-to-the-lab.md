Hi, I'm Jen—a Chemistry PhD with two years of industry experience who is transitioning into full-time
patent work. This site is the notebook I'm keeping public while I interview for patent agent roles.

### Why this space exists

- I needed a home to document the workflows I build for large-scale prior-art searches.
- Recruiters kept asking how I use AI in practice, so I decided to show my experiments instead of just
talking about them.
- Writing helps me connect the lab intuition I honed during my doctorate with the legal rigor required
for prosecution.

### What I'll publish

1. Patent landscape breakdowns for chemistry-heavy fields (catalysis, biomaterials, battery
   chemistry).
2. Python + LLM recipes for clustering claims, extracting competitive intelligence, and summarizing
   voluminous file histories.
3. Notes from the job search—what employers expect, how I prepare technical disclosures, and where AI
   copilots genuinely save time.

If you're building IP in a research-driven organization—or hiring a patent agent who can code—I'd love
to hear from you. Email me at [jen@jendau.com](mailto:jen@jendau.com) or connect on
