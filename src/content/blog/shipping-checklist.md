Before I send an analysis memo to counsel or publish it here, I run through the same checklist. It
keeps me honest and prevents surprises during interviews.

1. **Scope lock.** Confirm the question I'm answering (invalidity search, competitive landscaping,
   whitespace study) and restate it at the top of the document.
2. **Dataset hygiene.** Snapshot the data sources, API versions, and filters used to build the corpus.
   If I relied on AI summaries, I paste the prompt + parameters so the work can be reproduced.
3. **Claim mapping.** Highlight which claim elements each reference covers. I often include a table so
   legal teams can port it into their own templates.
4. **Risk notes.** Flag assumptions, chemistry-specific caveats, and manufacturing realities I learned
   from industry.
5. **Automation hooks.** Whenever a manual step takes longer than ~10 minutes, I log it as a scripting
   opportunity. Those notes feed future posts.

The list evolves, but the principle stands: every deliverable should be verifiable, auditable, and
useful to both scientists and attorneys.
