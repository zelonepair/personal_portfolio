Astro powers this site, but the real unlock is the content collection sitting behind it. Each notebook I
publish begins as a Python pipeline that aggregates USPTO bulk data, chemical literature, and my own
lab notes. I normalize the output into Markdown + frontmatter so that Astro can type-check every
entry before it ships.

Key ingredients:

- **Collections + schemas.** `defineCollection` throws an error when a post is missing metadata like
  filing date, art unit, or technology tags. That friction is welcomeâ€”it mirrors the discipline of a
  patent disclosure form.
- **Programmatic ingestion.** A short script converts CSV exports and JSON from the PatentsView API
  into Markdown drafts. I keep IDs human-readable so URLs stay stable when I move content around.
- **AI-assisted summaries.** LLMs provide first-pass highlights of independent claims or chemical
  scaffolds. I keep prompts + outputs in the same doc so reviewers can audit the reasoning.

This workflow scales down to a single invention disclosure and up to thousands of families. The code is
simple (mostly Pandas + Jinja), but the consistency lets collaborators scan analyses without hunting
through spreadsheets.
