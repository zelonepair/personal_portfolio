	<p>
		I'm a PhD chemist turned patent analyst with two years of industry experience guiding technology
		transfer from R&D into regulated production. I speak bench science, manufacturing constraints, and
		the language of claims.
	</p>
	<p>
		My niche is turning messy technical data into clear IP strategy. I write Python to mine patent
		families, use LLMs to summarize disclosures, and build visualizations that help attorneys and
		inventors see patterns faster.
	</p>
	<h2>What I bring</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Doctoral training in Chemistry (spectroscopy + synthesis focus).</li>
		<li>Recent industry experience scaling analytical workflows and mentoring scientists.</li>
		<li>Programming stack: Python, SQL, Astro, and modern AI tooling for search + summarization.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What I'm looking for</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Patent agent or technical specialist roles supporting chemical/material innovations.</li>
		<li>Teams that value data-backed prior-art research and experimentation with AI copilots.</li>
		<li>Opportunities to translate complex lab insights into strategic filings.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The blog here documents my patent analysis workflows, LLM experiments, and frameworks for keeping
		large art searches organized. If that resonates, let's talk.
