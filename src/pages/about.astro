	<p>
		I lead with curiosity. My day job focuses on front-end engineering—planning UIs, shaping design
		systems, and making sure the accessibility checklist is more than an afterthought. Over the past
		few years I've worked on dashboards, data visualizations, and fast-moving marketing sites. Each
		project sharpened a different muscle: animation, performance, content design, or just better
		communication with teammates.
	</p>
	<p>
		This blog is intentionally small. It gives me room to capture weeknotes, messy prototypes, and
		debug sessions so I can revisit them later. Lately I'm documenting my exploration of Astro,
		followed by experiments in automation (GitHub Actions, release pipelines) and a personal design
		system built from scratch.
	</p>
	<h2>Working style</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I value shipping in tiny slices and learning from real feedback.</li>
		<li>
			Clear writing is part of my engineering process—if I can explain it, I probably understand it.
		</li>
		<li>Design systems and content guidelines are living documents, not one-off tasks.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Currently learning</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Automating deployments (this site now ships via GitHub Pages Actions).</li>
		<li>Balancing Astro's island architecture with classic multi-page flows.</li>
		<li>Better visual storytelling with long-form articles.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Outside of code you'll usually find me sketching UI ideas, wandering through coffee shops, or
		writing long-form notes that eventually become blog posts here.
